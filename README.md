Bamazon for Customers
Bamazon allows the customer to see the items which are available for purchase.  It initially provides the item IDs, names, and prices to be viewed by the customer.  The customer is then able to purchase an item by specifying the ID of the item they would like to purchase, and how many they would like to purchase.  If enough of the item is in stock, the user's purchase is complete, and their total is displayed.  If enough of the item is not available, the customer is asked to pick another item, or purchase less of the item they are looking to purchase.
